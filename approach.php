                        <p>The context of your organization is unique. Your processes, clients and products are the results of great decision making in the past. Before we are going to work on design, we must first understand this context. This makes sure that we have focus before moving on.</p>

                        <p>After the baseline has been set, we take a good look at your organization, your industry and your customers. It is important to understand what truly drives your customers and your organization. Then, we will do research on their pain points and set up appropriate goals to improve these. We will set up KPIs to track the effectiveness of the implementation and start measuring the current situation.</p>
                        <p>We will provide deliverables which your team can directly implement. After implementation we do various tests to track the effectiveness of the changes. We then compare these results with the baseline to determine the success of the implementation and if the changes will pass.</p>

                        <h3>3. Iteration</h3>
                        <p>Most user experience improvements can be done by taking many small steps instead of giant leaps. Iteration is the key in creating better products for your customers. Every iteration should provide more insight in your product and customers and will give you tangible results.</p> 
                        <p>It is not the success of one project, but the grit of continuously improvements which will make and keep your product world class. Our team will be available for the next round of improvements and successive iterations.</p>
